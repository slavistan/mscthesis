  \section{Structured Matrices as Baseline Performance Indicators}

    In order to characterize the C3SR-format's storage scheme two families of matrices derived from structured grids are
    inspected. The matrices correspond to the 3-axial symmetric discretization of the Laplacian $\nabla^2 u(\vec{r}) =
    0$ over a structured cubic grid of edge size $d$ and correspond to a symmetric 7-point stencil operation, an example
    of which for $d = 5$ was shown previously and is reprinted here in Figure \ref{fig:laplacian-example-reprint} for
    convenience. For this project much larger structured grids ($50 \leq d \leq 200$) and sparse banded matrices
    derived thereof are examined. Although these matrices cannot be depicted explicitly due to their extensive sizes,
    they share all of their salient characteristics with the exemplary matrix which will be referred to in order to
    explain the inner details of the C3SR-format.

          sparse banded matrix derived from a grid with edge size $d=5$ is representative of the matrices used in this
          chapter to characterize the C3SR-format's storage scheme and benchmark its arithmetic performance.}
        \label{fig:laplacian-example-reprint}
    \end{figure}

    Given a fixed grid edge size $d$, the two corresponding matrices from both families differ only in their nonzeros'
    numerical values. The first matrix family's nonzeros are all identical while for the second family no two nonzeros
    share the same numerical value. This means that in addition to the ability to highly compress the matrix's
    structure, the C3SR-format also allows to store the nonzeros' values of matrices from the first family very
    compactly. This latter option is prohibited by the second matrix family's choice of values.

    The choice of matrices has been made to mimic the properties of real problems, where a structured grid's sparse
    banded matrix's nonzero values, i.e. the weights of connections between neighboring nodes, are determined by
    evaluating a continuous scalar field $\phi: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ at the midpoint between the two
    nodes in question. An exemplary scalar field, which has been used in this project beforehand, is
    $$
    \phi_{\vec{n}}(\vec{r}) = 2+
      \sin\bigg(\frac{r_x}{d_x}\cdot \pi \cdot n_x \bigg)+
      \sin\bigg(\frac{r_y}{d_y}\cdot \pi \cdot n_y \bigg)+
      \sin\bigg(\frac{r_z}{d_z}\cdot \pi \cdot n_z \bigg)
    $$

    where $d_i$ denotes the grid's edge size in each dimension, and incidentally also the grid's span if its origin is
    placed at the coordinate system's origin. $\vec{n}$ is a parameter determined by the underlying physical problem.
    Thus, in general for most problems no two rows' nonzeros will exhibits the same values and the C3SR-matrix's values
    array V will be densely populated. This configuration corresponds to the second family of matrices. Nevertheless
    there exist problems which yield $\vec{n} \equiv 0$ which causes all nonzeros to be equal meaning that the
    C3SR-format will store them very economically. This case corresponds to the first family of matrices.

    To avoid thinking about the matrix in terms of countless unwieldy calculations, the scalar field approach has been
    dropped in favor of the simplified notions introduced above. The salient characteristics of the matrices that matter
    for this project are that both types share the same structure and that the nonzeros of one type of matrix can be
    compressed while those of the second type cannot. This is equally well achieved by the methods used here which, as
    an additional benefit, entail a speedup during construction of the original CSR-matrix object as the computations
    for evaluating the scalar field are elided.

    Figure \ref{fig:test-matrices-object-size} shows the total matrix object size for a range of grid edge sizes and for
    both families. Note that for a given grid edge size $d$ the matrix objects' sizes vary hugely between the two
    families. This is solely due to the difference in the sizes of the values array V. The exact composition of the
    objects' total size will be examined in detail in the next section.

          difference is very small and cannot be resolved for the second family's plot. Thus, for all intents and
          purposes the COMP object's size contribution can be ignored. Additionally, for later reference, the storage
          sizes of the dense argument vector $x$ and the dense output vector $y$ of a matrix-vector multiplication $A
          \cdot x = y$ are plotted alongside the matrix object's size. As the matrix is square $dim(x) = dim(y)$ and
          thus both vectors require the same storage space.}

    The C3SR-matrix objects are created from the matrix's corresponding object in CSR-format according to the methods
    explained in Section \ref{sec:gen-of-c3sr-from-csr}. The CSR-matrices are created using Matrixgen, a sparse matrix
    creation toolkit, which has been developed alongside the C3SR-format project as an aid to its development. Matrixgen
    is briefly showcased in Part II of this thesis.

  \section{Relative Object Size for Fully Structured Matrices} \label{sec:rel-object-size-fully-structured}

    An insightful characteristic of a sparse matrix format is its object's storage space divided by the number of
    nonzeros in the matrix referred to as the \keyword{relative object size}. As previously stated, matrix-vector
    multiplication usually is a memory-bound operation and thus reducing the matrix's object size improves performance
    by limiting the amount of data that is required to move for the computation. As opposed to evaluating absolute
    object sizes, which are rather abstract without explicit knowledge of their context, the relative object size
    constitutes an intuitive heustic and can be conceived of as a `price' one has to pay for any additional nonzero.

    Using matrices from the two families introduced in the previous section their relative object sizes are examined as
    a function of the grid's edge size and are compared against the corresponding matrix object in CSR-format. The COMP
    array is be considered to be a part of the object regardless of the circumstance, that it's an asset solely used for
    vectorized matrix-vector multiplication. Analytical convergence values are derived for all configurations and
    corresponding measurement results are shown thereafter.

    \paragraph{Relative Storage Size for Matrices in CSR-Format}

    The CSR format's storage requirements are identical for both matrix families as they differ only in their nonzero's
    numerical values. Per nonzero one element is stored in the values array and in the column-index array in addition to
    one entry to the row-pointer array per matrix row. As for large matrices the vast majority of rows corresponds to
    inner nodes which all have $7$ nonzeros, or more formally, $\lim \limits_{d\rightarrow \infty}
    \frac{n_{\text{nnz}}}{n_{\text{row}}} = 7$. The number of rows can thus be expressed in terms of the number of
    nonzeros in the limit $d \rightarrow \infty$ and hence the storage requirements per nonzero amount to the following
    value:

          \lim \limits_{d \rightarrow \infty}\frac{n_{\text{Bytes}}}{n_{\text{nnz}}}

          = 12 + 4\cdot \lim \limits_{d \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n_{\text{nnz}}}{n_{\text{nrow}}}
          = 12 + \frac{4}{7}
          \approx 12.57
          $

          {$1^{\text{st}}$ and $2^{\text{nd}}$ Matrix Family in CSR-Format};
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}

    \paragraph{Relative Storage Size for Matrices in C3SR-Format}

    In order to analyze the relative storage requirements of the corresponding objects in C3SR-format the sizes of the
    individual data arrays must be examined. By design, matrices with unique values produce one element per nonzero in
    the values array V. J encodes the unique adjacency patterns of the matrix's nodes and thus locks in at $135$ elements for
    any $d \geq 3$, produced by the $8$ corners a $4$ neighbors, $12$ edges a $5$ neighbors, $6$ faces a $6$ neighbors
    and the inner nodes with $7$ neighbors each. In smaller grids one or more unique node classes are not present.

    Every node in a contiguously indexed set of inner nodes produces a contiguous segment of $7$ unique values within V
    and hence the index-pointers $vs_i$ in VS increase at a fixed increment of $7$ for these nodes, which allows the
    segment within VS to be condensed into a single run-length-increment encoded triplet, as illustrated in Figure
    \ref{fig:rlei-encoding-of-vs}. The constant stride offset between the $d-2$ elements $vs_i$ is eventually
    interrupted at the grid's border where the corresponding matrix rows have fewer nonzeros. Thus, with exceptions
    arising at rows corresponding to nodes at the $y$- and $z$-borders, VS chiefly consists of blocks of two
    RLI-triplets: the first for a contiguous segment of $d-2$ inner nodes as explained above followed by another triplet
    encoding the two nodes at the $x=d-1$ and $x=0$ boundaries, prefacing the next contiguous segment of inner rows. In
    total, there are $(d-2)^2$ such block pairs. Consider Figure \ref{fig:laplacian-example-reprint} as an example: The
    first contiguous segment of inner rows comprises indices $\{32, 33, 34\}$ and is followed by the boundary nodes
    $\{35, 36\}$. The next contiguous segment then follows at index $37$ etc.

      \toccaption{Section within V and VS pertaining to a contiguous segment of inner nodes for matrices from the second

        rows with 7 nonzeros and thus the corresponding section of VS comprises $d-2$ contiguous elements whose values
        increase at a constant stride of $7$. This constellation is efficiently condensed into a single
        run-length-increment encoded triplet.}
      \label{fig:rlei-encoding-of-vs}
    \end{figure}

    Similarly to the constellation created by contiguous inner nodes any set of contiguous nodes at the grid's faces or
    edges can be compressed into two or three RLI-triplets. However, as their number grows linearly with $d$ compared to
    $d^2$ for the grid's inner volume their effects become minute for larger $d$ and are of no consequence to
    convergence behavior.

    JS exhibits the very same structure as VS, consisting mainly of pairs of RLI-triplets which correspond to contiguous
    inner nodes. All inner nodes exhibit the same pattern, hence all corresponding $js_i$ point the same element in $J$,
    producing a single RLI-triplet followed by a second one for the two following border nodes. In contrast to $VS$,
    whose $vs_i$ exhibit a stride of $7$ between inner nodes, the $js_i$ exhibit no offset equal to a stride of $0$
    which thus allows them to be run-length-increment encoded in just the same manner. RS is subject to the very same
    reasoning as JS: Nodes in the inside of the grid produce slices of rows with $7$ nonzeros each, interrupted by nodes
    at the grid boundaries. 

    As exemplified in Figure \ref{fig:laplacian-example-reprint} nodes at any $z > 0$ are adjacent to another node
    situated below them in negative $z$-direction and thus the peg indices of two adjacent nodes at $z > 0$ are offset
    by $1$ carrying on for all following nodes. Hence the peg indices for all nodes with $z > 0$ are condensed into a
    single RLI-triplet. Similarly for $z = 0$ all nodes at $y > 0$ are stored by single RLI-triplet leaving, at worst,
    $d$ further triplets to be stored for the remainder of the matrix.
 
    Finally, the COMP array requires $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ bytes due to reasoning analogous to that pertaining to VS, JS
    and RS: SIMD chunks across inner nodes all produce the same composition yielding a single RLI-triplet followed by
    disturbances of this regularity at the grid's boundaries, after which the next chunk of rows corresponding to inner
    nodes is arrived at.

    Collating the above results yields that none of the data arrays except V require storage size larger than
    $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$. As $n_{\text{nnz}} \rightarrow 7\cdot d^3$ for increasing $d$ the storage size per nonzero
    converges to 8 for the second family of matrices, which is characterized by fully unique nonzeros.

    Considering matrices from the first family, whose nonzeros are all identical, note that the total number of elements
    in V is limited by unique classes of nodes in the grid, just as described above for J. In the same manner the
    storage requirements for $V$ are constant for all $d > 3$ and thus in $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Due to this VS exhibits the
    same configuration as JS in the case layed out above. J, JP and RS remain unchanged while COMP retains its storage
    size requirements of $\mathcal{O}(d^2)$. The composition of SIMD chunks across inner nodes only changes its type
    according to the new data layout. Thus the relative storage requirements of matrices from the first family, whose
    nonzeros are all identical, converges towards $0$.

    \paragraph{Measurement Results}

    A measurement of the relative object size is displayed in \ref{fig:bytespernnz} for a wide range of values of $d$
    and both families of matrices, comparing the CSR- and C3SR-format. The measured values are shown to converge very
    rapidly toward their respective analytical limits determined above. Matrices from the first family reach relative
    storage sizes of less than $1/10$ bytes per nonzero even for fairly small grid dimensions with values much lower for
    larger grids. Second family matrices, whose nonzeros all differ, reach convergence towards $8$ bytes per nonzero
    at tiny grid sizes of $\leq 50$. This means, that for the latter case the vast majority of storage space is spent
    for the nonzeros' values while the matrix structure is represented almost free of charge. In the other case, where
    the nonzeros are compressed, the compression scheme is powerful enough to approach the limit of vanishing storage
    costs.

        and the corresponding curve has been annotated only once. The matrix families correspond to the problem
        exemplified by Figure \ref{fig:laplacian-example} and differ only in the values of their nonzero elements, with
        the first family using a single constant value and the second family using unique values for each nonzero.
        Nonzeros are stored as 8-byte double precision floats while indices are stored as 4-byte integers. Only values
        for $d \geq 50$ are displayed for the sake of legibility, as the overhead of the C3SR format's compression
        scheme yields very large relative storage size requirements for small matrices. The C3SR-matrix object's size
        includes the COMP array.}
      \label{fig:bytespernnz}
    \end{figure}

    It should be noted that the matrices tested in this section present ideal use cases around which the C3SR-format was
    conceived. The effects of deviations from this ideal will be explored in the next section by introducing
    perturbations to the regularity of the matrices. Nevertheless the results show the C3SR-format to be a zero-cost
    compression scheme in that whichever aspect of a sparse banded matrix derived from a structured grid can be
    compressed, numerical values or structure, compresseses perfectly in the above sense.

  \section{Object Size per Nonzero for Perturbed Structured Matrices}

    In contrast to the fully structured matrices examined in the previous section many real-life problems produce
    matrices whose structure exhibits deviations from the ideal in individual, non-contiguous rows. Such configurations
    may arise where the underlying mathematical problem entails integration over $1$- or $2$-dimensional manifolds in
    $3$-dimensional domains. These manifolds intersect the grid along nodes whose indexing is not contiguous introducing
    perturbations to the regularity of the resulting linear system's coefficient matrix at seemingly random positions of
    rows. See Figure \ref{fig:structured-grid-with-path} for an illustration of this notion.

    \begin{figure}[H]

      \label{fig:structured-grid-with-path}
    \end{figure}

    In order to gauge the stability of the C3SR-format's compression scheme to such configurations, which can be
    considered as slight deviations from the best-case scenario, the experiment performed in the previous section is
    repeated with perturbations introduced into the matrices. Choosing random matrix rows, their nonzeros' values and
    positions within the row are randomized. The values are drawn from a uniform distribution over the half-open
    interval $[1, 2)$ while the column indices are randomly selected from all possible column index values without
    duplication. Given a grid with edge size $d$ and its initial, unperturbed matrix the relative storage density as
    bytes per nonzero is measured while varying the relative ratio of matrix rows to perturb. The experiment is repeated
    to account for its stochastic aspect.

    Measurement results for two samples of matrices, based on a small and a larger grid, $d = 50$ and $d = 200$, and
    perturbations of up to $10\%$ of matrix rows are showcased in Figure \ref{fig:bytespernnz-perturbed}. Both families
    of matrices are shown to be very stable with respect to increasing ratios of perturbed rows. Matrices from the
    second family display a decrease in storage density of approximately $1\%$ per $1\%$ increase in the relative number
    of perturbed rows. A separate measurement reveals that the C3SR-format surpasses the CSR-format in storage density
    even if $75\%$ of matrix rows are randomized in the manner explained above and only the remaining $25\%$ are
    retained in their original, structured form. While matrices from the first family show a much greater decrease in
    storage density, their absolute values are very small, reaching approximately $2$ bytes per nonzero at $10\%$
    perturbed rows.  Except for different starting points of the unperturbed matrices, their underlying grid's size does
    not have any qualitative impact.

        {For each family two matrices corresponding to two different grids are perturbed by randomizing a portion of
        their rows. Each perturbed row has its nonzeros' positions shuffled and their numeric values randomized. The
        matrix objects relative storage size is measured as a gauge of the C3SR-format's stability to perturbations from
        the ideal configuration. The graphs display mean values over 1000 iterations for each degree of perturbation.

    The decrease in storage density is owed to the fact that a perturbed row's column indices are randomized,
    effectively increasing the pattern array J by $7$ elements and, for the first family of matrices whose values array
    V is essentially empty, also adding $7$ new unique values to V. Due to the fact, that the second family of matrices'
    V array is by far the largest of all of its data arrays, and because V does not increase in size as the values are
    uncompressible in the first place, randomizing a row has less effect than for first family matrices, explaining the
    difference in the decrease in storage density. In addition, run-length-increment encoding of the structural
    information of contiguous rows corresponding to segments of contiguous inner nodes is inhibited by every randomized
    matrix row within the segment for both matrix families.

  % The matrix-vector multiplication performance of the C3SR format is measured in its CSR-like and vectorized
  % implementations (see \ref{subsec:matrix-vector-multiplication-schemes}). Firstly, a baseline performance is
  % established by comparing the matrix-vector multiplication performance of the C3SR format's CSR-like multiplication
  % scheme introduced in \ref{subsubsec:basic-csr-like-multiplication-scheme} against the CSR format's performance on
  % different sparse banded matrices derived from structured grids and on three different machines. Secondly, the C3SR
  % format's baseline performance is compared against its vectorized counterpart introduced in
  % \ref{subsubsec:vectorized-simd-multiplication-scheme}.

  % The following subsection introduces the sparse banded matrices used for the performance benchmarks and their method of
  % acquisition. Subsequently, the results of the performance benchmarks are discussed. Information on the machines used
  % for the benchmarks can be found at the ASC infrastructure
  % wiki\footnote{https://mp-force.ziti.uni-heidelberg.de/kmbeutel/personal-wiki/wikis/ASC-infrastructure} (the KNL was
