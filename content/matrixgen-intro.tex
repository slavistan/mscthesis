WIP;

During the creation of the part 1 experimentation with many matrices of various shapes and sizes was required. For this
the source code grew and eventually was encapsulated into an independent project.

Focus on grids derived from structured grids; but also many simple tools

Idea: Preset matrices for all purposes.

As this was an aid to development of caesr the focus lies on simple interface, and consistency. Where necessary ease of
use and maintability were preferred over performance gain.

Note: Makes intensive use of TMP the capabilities of which have enjoyed massive improvements over the last iterations of
the c++ standard. hence C++20 is used and users with version limitations (such as cuda zealots) are required to write a
simple wrapper to create a static library.

Output object format specified as template parameter making the interface easily expandable to different
output formats.
