Scan of row-sizes for load-balancing mvm.

Further shrink COMP by including it indirectly into JS. COMP analysis is much faster on the RLI-enc'd arrays.

Further control over NUMA allocation. Mapping of arrays' sections to NUMA nodes can only be done perfectly AFTER the
object has been created and it known, which NUMA nodes access which sections of V (complex matrices).
